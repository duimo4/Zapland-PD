<h3>ID:261181</h3>
<h3>DATE:18/07/2017</h3>
<h3>LOCATION:Zapland, Zata, 3 Gordons Street</h3>
<h3>CRIME:Chargeback fraud</h3>
<h3>STATUS:Closed</h3>
<h3>SUMMARY:I PZ Rabbit Rock responded to Zata 3 Gordons Street where i went inside the alleged place of the crime "In the landlords office in the motel" where the suspect was trying to argue with the victim (The landlord) but i deescalated it and asked to review both the suspect and victim and after, i talked to the company of the suspect which led me to my conclusion: The suspect overpayed the Landlord, then the landlord gave him cashback but the room was payed by the company of the suspect (Chargeback fraud).</h3>

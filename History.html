<h1><u>Zapland was founded in 1427 by John Gardener.</u></h1>
<p>John Gardener was of the royal Gardener family. He found a former city struck by a meteorite and decided to turn it into the amazing town it is today - Zapland. But one challange stood his way.. His family, his family was extremly superstitious causing John to go mad and murder his (all fictional) family, tore their skin with his bare hands, and caused immense viscera.. Thats what people think happened atleast. No one knows.</p>
